                <p>
                    Tim Thomas was born April 15, 1974 in Michigan. He played college hockey
                    for the University of Vermont for four years from 1993 to 1997; during this
                    time he was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques (now the Colorado Avalanche)
                    but did not accept the offer. During his college career, he went 81-43-15
                    with a 2.70 goals against average, and still holds the third spot for saves
                    in NCAA Division I history.<br>

                    Thomas began his starting role as goaltender for the Bruins in the 2006-07
                    NHL season. His best years came in 2008-09 and 2010-11, in which he posted
                    excellent .933 and .938 save percentages, respectively.
